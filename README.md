- [A function that multiplies a lower triangular matrix and a vector using the partitioned dot-product of rows of the matrix with the vector, by expanding the top left quadrant by one row and one column at a time, and overwriting the input vector without using work space](Trmv_ln_unb_var1.m)

- [A function that multiplies a lower triangular matrix and a vector using the partitioned linear combination (AXPY) of the columns of this given matrix, by expanding the top left quadrant by one row and one column at a time, and overwriting the input vector without using work space](Trmv_ln_unb_var2.m)

- [A function that uses triple-nested loops to compute the matrix-matrix multiplication](Trmv_ln_unb_var2.m)
